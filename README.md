# NormalEights
This holds some detailed information for my card game "normal eights"



# How to play
The game is played like a standard game of Crazy Eights, only with each card (except for the 8), carrying some unique effect.


# Crazy Eights Rules
*If you already know how to play Crazy Eights then skip this.*

(Similar to Uno) Each player is dealt 7 cards from the deck. Deck is placed in the middle and one card is placed face up (the top card). Players take turns clockwise. On a player's turn he can either: 
- play a card from his hand onto the top card iff it matches either the suit or the face of the card (eg. hearts on hearts or five on five)
- draw the top card from his deck; he can then choose to play **this card** (if it meets the condition above)
The first player to run out of cards, wins.


# Normal Eights Card Effects
*Each card in normal eights does something special, except for the 8. Below are the effects*

- **2 [War]** - All players must pick a card from their hand and place it face down on the table in front of them. After counting to 3 the cards are flipped face-up simultaneously. The highest card(s) is(/are) discarded with no effect (multiple cards are discarded only on a tie. See **"resolving multiple discards"** below). 
- **3 [Collect 3]** - The user must draw 3 cards from the deck.
- **4 [Show]** - The user must lay his hand face up, fully visible, until the start of his next turn. Skips prolong this.
- **5 [Revere]** - The user picks a target player. Target player must choose a card from his own deck to give to the user.
- **6 [Not Rummi]** - All players are given an oppertunity to discard sets of cards with no effect which meet one of the conditions: [3+ of a kind (eg. 2, 2, 2), run of 3+ in the same suit (eg. 2, 3, 4)]. (the sets of cards you can lay out in the game **Rummi**. The user may not use his base 6 card to make a set with two other cards. Players can not "build upon" other player's sets. See **"resolving multiple discards"** below).
- **7 [Purge]** - All players except the user discard a card with no effect (See **"resolving multiple discards"** below).
- **8 [8]** - Just an Eight. It's Normal Eights, remember?
- **9 [Reverse]** - Reverse the turn order.
- **10 [Replay]** - The user plays again. This can happen multiple times in one turn if the user has multiple 10s.
- **J [Skip]** - The user picks any player. That player's next turn is skipped. Multiple skips can be stacked on a player with multiple cards.
- **Q [Wild] CAN BE PLAYED ON ANY SUIT** - The user picks the new suit to be played.
- **K [Draw]** - The user picks any player. That player draws 4 cards.
- **A [NOPE] CAN NOT BE PLAYED IN TURN NORMALLY** - Ace can be played in response to any card being played, nullifying the effect of that card. The user decides whether the player of that card will take the card back into their hand or not. Ace can be played out of turn, interrupting someone else's card immediately after they've played it (eg. on a K to avoid drawing 4). Aces can be used to nullify the effect of other Aces. Aces can be used to stop a player from winning by forcing them to take their card back. A user can play an Ace on his own card (eg. on a 3 to avoid drawing 3) to nullify the effect. Aces don't have to be played in suit. Aces cannot be played normally. Aces can only be played in response to a player playing a card. Aces cannot be used in response to someone discarding a card with no effect, or someone drawing a card from the deck instead of playing. *The Ace also changes the suit by being the new top card.*


# Resolving Multiple Discards
*What to do when multiple players are allowed to discard with no effect at the same time*

In the event that multiple players are discarding at once (such as when a 7 is played, when a War ties, or when multiple players discard sets on a 6), the order of operations begins with the user (the player who played the source card that triggered the discards), and goes around the table in the current turn order (default is clockwise unless reversed by a 9), such that the player who's turn falls immediately before the user will have his card on top. (In the event of a 6, where multiple cards are discarded, the user on top can choose any of his cards to be the top card, setting the face and suit to be played).



# Other Notes
- You can choose to draw a card instead of playing, or if you don't have any playable cards you must draw a card. You cannot draw multiple cards.
- If multiple players run out of cards on the same turn (such as in the event of a 7), they both win.
- Players can't hide / lie about how many remaining cards they have.
- Jokers are optional and can serve as whatever card the user wants.
